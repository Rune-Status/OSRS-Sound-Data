# OSRS-Sound-Data
A repository containing sound data from Old School RuneScape in a readable (or listenable) format.


How it's organized - an example:


Idx14: 1_59


Where Idx14 is Index 14, 1 is the ID of the sample, 
and 59 is the corresponding note that is being played.

More info on the note ranges and such in Index 15.
